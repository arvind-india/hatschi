# hatschi

Hatschi (cutesy german way of saying "bless you") is an application that
automatically tracks respiratory symptoms of the cold, the flu or COVID-19 in
particular. It automatically assesses these symptoms through usage of a
microphone and gives the user a statistical overview of the amount of symptoms
shown throughout the day. That data is furthermore used to give health
recommendations to the user, i.e. to stay at home or to get tested for COVID-19.

## WirVsVirus Hackathon

This app has been created as part of the "WirVsVirus" Hackathon held by the
federal government of Germany to fight the corona virus disease.
